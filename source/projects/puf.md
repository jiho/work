The project is funded by the [Partner University Fund](http://www.facecouncil.org/puf/ "Partner University Fund"), with $80k per year for three years. The title and general scope of the project is *Bio-physical interactions at mesoscale in the ocean*. I am coordinating it on the french side.

During three years, students and professors will travel to take or give classes, perform internships and discuss. Our goal is to improve the education curriculum at the edge between physics and biology and to tie links between our two, very similar, institutions across the Atlantic ocean.

The research projects are focused on *in situ* imagery to explore the fine scale distribution of zooplankton across a mesoscale feature (year 1) and the orientation or larval fish in response to environmental cues (year 2).

You can read news about that research, the impressions of the students after traveling, and more on the project's website: <http://puf.rsmas.obs-vlfr.fr/>.
