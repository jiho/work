[Plankton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankton "Plankton - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia") is usually considered to be mostly passive. Actually, that is even part of its definition: planktonic organisms are those which drift with oceanic currents, incapable of swimming against them. I am interested in uncovering how passive these organisms really are (hint: they are not!).
